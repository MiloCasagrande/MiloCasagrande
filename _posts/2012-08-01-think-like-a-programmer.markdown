Another quick post for a small promotion, always from the lovely [No Starch Press](http://nostarch.com/). This time is the turn of the book "[Think Like a Programmer](http://nostarch.com/thinklikeaprogrammer)", by [V. Anton Spraul](http://www.vantonspraul.com/).

As for the [previous promotion](http://www.milo.name/2012/07/18/ubuntu-made-easy-promo-code/), you can get 40% off on the paper version, plus the DRM-free ebook versions. The promotion lasts one week, and here is your chance to have it:

I'm reading the book now, No Starch asked me to write a review, and I have to say it is an enjoyable and challenging reading.

Go get it, for new programmers and also for seasoned ones, it is always interesting to challenge your mind and your knowledge.
