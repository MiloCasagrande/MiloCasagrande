Almost six months ago I started working for [Linaro](http://www.linaro.org), from home. It was the first time for me with a home-based job, and I'm enjoying every minutes of it.

Before joining Linaro I did my fairly amount of researches on the Internet about how to organize your workday and also your life: try to do as if you had to get ready for office, eat & drink, do not always stand sit...

I didn't change much of my usual habits, and I'm trying to keep home and work activities as much as possible separate from each other. Sometimes they will interfere, but I guess it is normal, as long as you remember to stick to your plan of separating them.

So, this is something I would call my usual day...

#### Getting Out of Bed

I'm an "early bird" as to speak.

I like getting up early in the morning. Luckily from where we live, opening the window we can see the sea and the sun rising. Getting out of bed is not that bad after all.

During the warmer months I also enjoy going out jogging for 40 minutes, during the colder months I usually start my days with a 30-40 minutes training. Nothing much heart-pumping, and everything weight-free, just free body weight: abs, squat, push-ups, and lots of stretching (sometimes even yoga, but my yoga-skills are really rudimentary). On the Internet you can find plenty of videos and web-sites on how to train in the correct way and for how much, so you still get to vary your training (I still haven't found a really good Android app for something I would call zen-training: a mix of body and mind exercises, that doesn't get much into the way, and that suggests you exercises).

Shower, that helps me like a caffeine shot (I do not drink coffee, even if I drink tea), and a big breakfast. Breakfast that for me is the most important meal of the day.

No computer or any electronic gadgets activities until after breakfast.

#### The Work Day

I sit in front of the PC around 8-8.30, checking emails, reading newspapers and the usual social websites. At 9, my (virtual) [pomodoro](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) clock usually starts ticking. I try to organize my working days in that way, sticking to the pomodoro technique as much as possible, and having pomodoro times also for checking IRC and other work related activities I have to do online.

#### Code, Eat & Drink

I always have something to drink next to my keyboard. Sometimes it even gets on my keyboard, but that's another story...

Tea in the morning, that usually propels me almost close to lunch time, then water. I do not eat anything else in the morning, and in the afternoon sometimes I have a little break and usually I eat a fruit. At lunch time, I cook: I enjoy cooking, and it is one activity that me and my girlfriend enjoy doing in the evening together. It is a good moment for talking, and for preparing food.

#### Getting Into Bed Again

After dinner, we spend time on the couch watching movies, or doing our open-source-communities related activities. I also enjoy doing a 10-15 minutes streching/yoga session before getting into bed again. And before falling asleep, I always read a good book.

As in all rules that you set for yourself, form time to time I do not follow them, without feeling guilty. I need the liberty of doing what I like to do, with the confidence of getting back to my habits.
