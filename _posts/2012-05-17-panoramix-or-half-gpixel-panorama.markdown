Before heading to the UDS-Q me and my girlfriend went to Paris for a long weekend (since in 1yr that I live in France I had never visited it properly). We spent 4 fantastic days there, heading in and out from the Parisien metro and walking our way throught out the city, even in not so tourist places.

As usual, coming back home, I had like 5 GByte of pictures in my camera, and due to the few days before leaving for the USA, I hadn't had the time to process them. Come back from the UDS, and [here there is the Paris photostream](http://www.ipernity.com/doc/milo/album/271527).

One picture was still missing though, since it required a little bit of work, and yesterday night I eventually managed to "compose" it. Compose because it is a "small" panorama, made of 7 pictures, taken while sitting on the [Seine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine) banks close to [Notre Dame](http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/). The view goes from Notre Dame on the left to the [Hotel de Ville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B4tel_de_Ville,_Paris) on the right, plus other buildings looking at the river. The original TIFF format of the panorama wheighs in at 2.6 GB of disk space, measuring 46366*14910 pixels, it takes like 5 minutes on my machine to open with Gimp, and it took me something like 4 hours of work: loading the 7 TIFF images with [Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/), processing it for the first time, manually adding as much matching-points as possible, waiting for the final result, and finally opening it up with Gimp to play with it in different ways (next time I will use [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)).

This is a small-size result:

A little bit bigger image can be [found on my gallery](http://www.ipernity.com/doc/milo/12706513).

I'm happy with the outcome, it's the hugest panorama I have ever created. I think me and my girlfriend will print it out (not in the original size, 'cause it will be close to 7 meters!) and hang it somewhere around the house.
