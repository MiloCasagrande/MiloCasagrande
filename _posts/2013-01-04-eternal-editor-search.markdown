### Finding the perfect code editor

In my eternal search for a no resource hungry (Python) code editor that can help you getting things done easily and quickly, I started using [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) at its 2.0 version (albeit not being an open source project).

I never used Mac OS X [TextMate](http://macromates.com/), but some people described SublimeText as a valid alternative to that editor, and I always heard good words about TextMate.

After using SublimeText for almost 4 months, I'm finding myself really happy with the cool working experience it provides and its capabilities.

What I found most interesting in these months are:

  * [Loads of plugins](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/community)
  * Code completion (through one of its many plugins)
  * JSON based configuration files
  * Great project support, with almost instant project switch through the command palette
  * A very responsive command palette
  * Integration with static code analysis tools
  * Powerful editing capabilities (multi-selection editing in primis)
  * Possibility to integrate the Python debugger
  * Integrated Python console
  * A "disctraction free" mode (now called it like that, but it is just full screen editing

It has [extensive](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/) [documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/index.html), and also [nifty video tutorial](https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/) to set-up a dev environment with ease.

In the next months I will polish my [vim-fu](http://www.vim.org/), I want to do some tests using the [Chromebook](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/) with its Chrome OS for development purposes. Almost all of my dev activities happen online, and through a Google hosted account and Chrome OS has a decent shell with SSH support (and also different SSH plugins available in the Chrome Web Store). I just need a VM, or a VPS somewhere, where to store the code and all the development tools, and see how it plays out.
