Being overwhelmed by passwords, for all the disparate websites you have to login to, plus trying to keep safe password for personal and work activities without sharing the same ones, was starting to get harder. Too many websites, to much passwords.

#### The Last Password to Remember

As a colleague of mine suggested, I tried out [LastPass](http://lastpass.com). A nicely done online services that offers you the possibility to have a secure password vault where to store your passwords and identities. LastPass integrates also with your browser and helps you:

  * Filling out forms: you can store all your credentials and credit card info too
  * Logging into the stored web sites, also automatically if you tell it so
  * Creating one time and secure passwords
  * Updating the passwords when it detects you are changing them
  * And lots more...

You can even use it with a [YubiKey](http://www.yubico.com/) and with [Google Autheticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en) for a two-factors authentication, and it also has a "security challenge" where it tells you if any of your accounts were compromised or how strong are your passwords.  The service is really well done and provides you with a smooth experience (even if the graphical web interface is not the best around).

But it is not open source. This is the kind of service I would like to have as a truly open source project. Are there any open source project like this out there?

In case you want to give LastPass a try, you can use this referral URL: [https://lastpass.com/f?1328416](https://lastpass.com/f?1328416)
