For the English speaking audience (but not only). If you are interested in a new book on the latest LTS version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), [No Starch Press](http://nostarch.com/) is promoting "[Ubuntu Made Easy](http://nostarch.com/ubuntumadeeasy)" for one week, 40% off on the paper version, and you get DRM-free ebooks format (PDF, mobi, epub) with it.

The link to the promotional code is here:
[http://nostar.ch/UME_Promo](http://nostar.ch/UME_Promo)

Spread the voice, and grab it as fast as you can!

The book is really worth it if you are getting closer to Linux for the first time, but still an interesting reading for all.

PS: I technically reviewed the book.
