Here I am, writing from San Franciso, the first report for the (ongoing) day 1 of the [Ubuntu Developer Summit](http://uds.ubuntu.com/) (UDS) that will shape Ubuntu 12.10.

It all started in a very good way, flight was (almost) on time, [Alessio](http://www.alessiotreglia.com/) was blocked for a couple of hours at immigration, [Leo](http://www.leoiannacone.com/blog/) was stopped and had to open up all of his bags, but eventually we made it to the hotel safe and sound.

Oakland, on the other side of the San Francisco Bay, looks to be a nice city to hang around: there are small restaurants around the corner from our hotel, some local breweries, a board games shop just in from of us, a sunny and warm weather, everything that you need!

Already quite a lot of interesting stuff heard and discussed about: [Mark and Calxeda showcasing the first Ubuntu ARM server](http://armservers.com/2012/05/07/calxeda-demonstrates-ubuntu-12-04-lts-on-energycore-soc/), numbers of Ubuntu installation around the world, HP talking about its certification for 12.04, a lot of chats about juju and charms, and devop, [Linaro](http://www.linaro.org/)... Looks like cloud is the big word around here (tomorrow there will be a cloud summit too).

Interesting week ahead.
